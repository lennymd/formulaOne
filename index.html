      Hi â€” this piece was made as part of my graduation project in 2019.
      Combined with my time as a Carnegie-Knight News21 fellow, and my semester
      as a teaching assistant for MIT's Product Engineering Processes course
      (2.009), it reflects my goal of combining the fields of engineering,
      design, and journalism.

      version I presented in august 2019 here:
