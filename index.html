  <h1>A work in progress</h1>
  <br>
  <p>Hello!</p>
  <p>I defended my master's work in early August and passed with modifications. The day of my defense I spoke about my work after I left Syracuse:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>my time with News21, and </li>
      <li>my experience as a teaching assistant for MIT's Product Engineering Processes capstone class.</li>
    </ul><br>
    I also showed a data visualization piece about Formula 1. You can see the original piece here: <a href="v0/">Version 0</a>. The goal of the piece is to be a personal essay into how one thinks of putting together a data-driven story with visuals.
  </p>
  <p>The original version wasn't 100% speaking to those goals, so I'm working on it and once I'm done, this page will be replaced by the improved piece. If you have any questions or are curious on progress, send me a message on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/lennymartinezd">@lennymartinezd</a>) or via email (<a href="mailto:lennymartinezd@gmail.com">lennymartinezd@gmail.com</a>).</p>
  <p>Best regards,<br>
    <strong>Lenny Martinez</strong><br>
