					<h1>The best Formula 1 team</h1>

						I want to add a graphical way of introducing the champions, and the teams we'll be looking at.<br>

						In the 69-year history of the sport, over 800 men and 5 women have raced to win the Driver's Cup, but only <strong>33</strong> drivers have held it.
					</p>
					<p class="counters" >Michael Schumacher (7), Juan Manuel Fangio (5), Lewis Hamilton (5), Alain Prost (4),Sebastian Vettel (4), Jack Brabham (3), Jackie Stewart (3), Niki Lauda (3), Nelson Piquet (3), Ayrton Senna (3), Alberto Ascari (2), Graham Hill (2), Jim Clark (2), Emerson Fittipaldi (2), Mika Häkkinen (2), Fernando Alonso (2), Giuseppe Farina (1), Mike Hawthorn (1), Phil Hill (1), John Surtees (1), Denny Hulme (1), Jochen Rindt (1), James Hunt (1), Mario Andretti (1), Jody Scheckter (1), Alan Jones (1), Keke Rosberg (1), Nigel Mansell (1), Damon Hill (1), Jacques Villeneuve (1), Kimi Räikkönen (1), Jenson Button (1), Nico Rosberg (1)</p>
					<p>These 33 drivers have all raced for 16 different constructors:</p>
					<p class="counters">Ferrari, McLaren, Williams, Mercedes, Lotus, Red Bull, Brabham, Renault, Cooper, Benetton, Tyrrell, Alfa Romeo, BRM, Matra, Brawn GP</p>

								<p>Looking at just this, we can see that Mercedes's 2014–2016 performance was quite strong, securing the first 3 spots.</p>

								<p>In these three years, Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg won 51 of the 59 races, finishing first and second in the drivers's cup each year.</p>

								<p>While looking at the number of wins in a season is a good place to start, we still can't make a great comparison. In 2016, when Mercedes won 19 of the season's races, there were 21 races. In 2014 and 2015 there were 19 races in each season. If we look at the runs right behind these, McLaren's 1988 run and Ferrari's 2002 and 2004 runs, there were 16, 17, and 18 races in each season respectively.</p>

								<p>If we look all the way to the inagural season, 1950, there were only 7 races.</p>

							<div class="step" data-index="0">
								<p>If we want to properly compare the number of wins a constructor had in a season, we have to account for the different number of races in each season.</p>
								<p>We can do this by dividing the number of wins in each run by the number of races in that season. For Mercedes's 2016 run it would be:<br>
									$$ \frac{wins}{races} = \frac{19}{21} = 0.904761905 $$

								<p>In 1988, McLaren got the closest to having a perfect season. Drivers Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna won every race in the season except the 1988 Italian Grand Prix.</p>

								<p>In the Italian Grand Prix that year, Senna had pole position and Prost was second on the grid, but they did not manage to win. Prost was forced to retire due to engine problems, and Senna, after leading for 49 laps and with only two laps to go, had a collision with a Williams' driver and finished tenth.</p>

								<p>In spite of the loss at the Italian Grand Prix, Senna and Prost had a remarkable season, winning 8 and 7 races respectively.</p>

								<p>Behind McLaren's 1988 and Mercedes's 2016 runs is Ferrari's 2002 run. In 2002, Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello won 15 of the season's 17 races.</p>

								<p>Looking on the other end of the spectrum, the Formula One run with the least number of wins is Williams's 1982 run. In that year, Keke Rosberg (Nico Rosberg's father) only managed to win the Swiss Grand Prix, but still ended up winning the driver's championship.</p>

					<h2 class="subhed method_step">Method 02: Podiums in season</h2>
					<p>While looking at the number of wins in each season is a good place to start, it still doesn't tell us a lot.</p>
			
					<p>If we look more closely at the top three runs by win percentage, it's clear that both drivers in each run won races. Of those top three teams, each driver (with the exception of Rubens Barichello) won the Formula One Driver's cup at least once.</p>
					
					<p>So, an indicator of a team having a good season is if their drivers are both performing well. Looking at wins&mdash;which focus on the person who the race&mdash;can't tell us much about how all of a team's drivers are performing.</p>
					
					<p>It might be better though to look at podiums. The podium refers to the first, second, and third place finishers in a race. A team that is doing well would have both*(<span class="nb">in earlier seasons constructors had more than two drivers</span>) of their drivers on the podium </p>

							<div class="step" data-index="0">
								<p>Looking at the raw number of podiums, Mercedes' 2014&ndash;2016 performance is still the highest. This is a testament to their dominance of the hybrid-engine era of Formula One.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="step" data-index="0">
								<p>To better compare things, we should normalize things. We should take into account the number of races in a season and the number of drivers a team has.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="step" data-index="0">
								<p>If there are \(n\) races in a season, and \(3\) podium spots per race, then it might seem like a good idea to divide the number of podiums a team got by \(3 \cdot n\) avalaible spots.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="step" data-index="0">
								<p>But, for most of the sport's history there have only been two drivers per team. So the most podium spots a team can claim is \(2 \cdot n\), where \(n\) is still the number of races in the season.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="step" data-index="0">
								<p>This is a good idea for normalizing the number of podiums a team claimed, and would work for most of the seasons. It wouldn't work for the earlier seasons where teams had more than 2 drivers on any one race. If we divided everything by \(2 \cdot n\) spots, we'd end up with certain seasons having over 100% of the podium spots when that wasn't the case.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="step" data-index="0">
								<p>Instead we can compute a flexible number of podium spots for each team by looking at the number of drivers that entered each race.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="step" data-index="0">
								<p>We can do this by going race by race in a season. If three or more drivers entered a race, the number of podium spots available for that race are three. Else the number of podium spots are the number of drivers who entered the race.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="step" data-index="0">
								<p>If we do this for every race in each season, we have a total number of podium spots we can divide by. Looking at Mercedes's 2016 run again, the percentage we would compute would be:</p>
									<p>\(\frac{33}{42}= 0.7857 \) or \(78.57\% \)</p>
							</div>
							<div class="step" data-index="2">
								<p>Doing this for every other championship run gives us:</p>
							</div>
							<div class="step" data-index="0">
								<p>And Mercedes's 2016 run which ranked first in both number of podium spots and wins and second in terms of win percentage, is fifth in terms of the percentage of available podium spots claimed.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="step" data-index="0">
								<p>McLaren's 1988 run which had the highest win percentage came in sixth in terms of podium percentages.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="step" data-index="0">
								<p>Ferrari's 2002 run which was third in win percentage came in fourth in terms of podium percentages.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="step" data-index="0">
								<p>At the top of this list we now have Mercedes's 2015 run followed by their 2014 run. In 2015, Rosberg and Hamilton were both on podium for 15 of the 19 races. In 2014 it was 13 of the 19 races.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="step" data-index="0">
								<p>Mercedes's performance in these two years set the pace for their domination of the hybrid-engine era, which started in 2014. Ahead of the 2014 season the FIA (Formula One's managing body) changed engine regulations, moving away from the 2.4-litre V8 engines to 1.6-litre V6 turbocharged engines. <span class="nb">I'm a bit stuck on what/how much to talk about each run.</span>
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="step" data-index="0">
								<p>Right behind them is Ferrari's 2004 run, where Schumacher and Barrichello together claimed 29 podiums over the course of the season's 18 races. They were both on podium for 10 of those races.</p>

					<h2 class="subhed method_step">Method 03: How close to perfect</h2>
					<p>Winning is good, having both drivers in the podium is good too, but the best performance for a constructor is to have their drivers finish first and second, a 1-2 finish (read: "one-two finish"). A 1-2 finish means that compared to the competition of a grand prix, the drivers were in top shape, the car had no problems, and the non-racing part of the team (engineers, pit crew, etc.) were in sync and the team had a perfect weekend.</p>
