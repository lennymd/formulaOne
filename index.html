      Hi â€” this piece was made as part of my graduation project in 2019.
      Combined with my time as a Carnegie-Knight News21 fellow, and my semester
      as a teaching assistant for MIT's Product Engineering Processes course
      (2.009), it reflects my goal of combining the fields of engineering,
      design, and journalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the initial <a href="./v0/index.html">version</a>, I've done more
      work with this data and improved my coding abilities, so I want to improve
      the essay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the next few months, I'll work on creating a new version of the essay
      with more recent data.
