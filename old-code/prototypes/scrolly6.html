			In the 69-year history of the sport, over 800 men and 5 women have raced to win the Driver's Cup, but only <strong>33</strong> drivers have held it.

		<p class="counters" >Michael Schumacher (7), Juan Manuel Fangio (5), Lewis Hamilton (5), Alain Prost (4),Sebastian Vettel (4), Jack Brabham (3), Jackie Stewart (3), Niki Lauda (3), Nelson Piquet (3), Ayrton Senna (3), Alberto Ascari (2), Graham Hill (2), Jim Clark (2), Emerson Fittipaldi (2), Mika Häkkinen (2), Fernando Alonso (2), Giuseppe Farina (1), Mike Hawthorn (1), Phil Hill (1), John Surtees (1), Denny Hulme (1), Jochen Rindt (1), James Hunt (1), Mario Andretti (1), Jody Scheckter (1), Alan Jones (1), Keke Rosberg (1), Nigel Mansell (1), Damon Hill (1), Jacques Villeneuve (1), Kimi Räikkönen (1), Jenson Button (1), Nico Rosberg (1)</p>
		<p>These 33 drivers have all raced for 16 different constructors:</p>
		<p class="counters">Ferrari, McLaren, Williams, Mercedes, Lotus, Red Bull, Brabham, Renault, Cooper, Benetton, Tyrrell, Alfa Romeo, BRM, Matra, Brawn GP</p>

					<p>While looking at the number of wins in a season is a good place to start, we still can't make a great comparison. In 2016, when Mercedes won 19 of the season's races, there were 21 races. In 2014 and 2015 there were 19 races in each season. If we look at the runs right behind these, McLaren's 1988 run and Ferrari's 2002 and 2004 runs, there were 16, 17, and 18 races in each season respectively.</p>

					<p>If we look all the way to the inagural season, 1950, there were only 7 races.</p>

				<div class="step" data-index="-1">
					<p>If we want to properly compare the number of wins a constructor had in a season, we have to account for the different number of races in each season.</p>
					<p>We can do this by dividing the number of wins in each run by the number of races in that season. For Mercedes's 2016 run it would be:<br>
						$$ \frac{wins}{races} = \frac{19}{21} = 0.904761905 $$

					<p>In 1988, McLaren got the closest to having a perfect season. Drivers Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna won every race in the season except the 1988 Italian Grand Prix.</p>

					<p>In the Italian Grand Prix that year, Senna had pole position and Prost was second on the grid, but they did not manage to win.

					<p>As mentioned earlier, Mercedes's 2016 run is second in terms of win percentage. A neat thing to note is that the 2016 champion, Nico Rosberg, is the son of the 1982 champion, Keke Rosberg. Whereas Nico's championship year saw his team have the second highest win percentage, Keke's championship year has both the lowest win percentage and the lowest number of wins. Keke Rosberg only won the 1982 Swiss Grand Prix.</p>

		<h2 class="subhed">Method 02: Podiums in season</h2>
		<p>Looking at the number of wins in each season is a good place to start, but we can do better. If we look more closely at the top three runs by win percentage, it's clear that both drivers in each run won races. In fact for those top three teams, each driver (with the exception of Rubens Barichello) won the Formula One Driver's cup at least once.</p>
		
		<p>So, an indicator of a team having a good season is if their drivers are both performing well. Looking at wins&mdash;which focus on the person who the race&mdash;can't tell us much about how all of a team's drivers are performing.</p>
		
		<p>It might be better though to look at podiums. The podium refers to the first, second, and third place finishers in a race. A team that is doing well would have both*(<span class="nb">in earlier seasons constructors had more than two drivers</span>) of their drivers on the podium </p>

		<h2 class="subhed">Method 03: How close to perfect</h2>
		<p>Winning is good, having both drivers in the podium is good too, but the best performance for a constructor is to have their drivers finish first and second, a 1-2 finish (read: "one-two finish"). A 1-2 finish means that compared to the competition of a grand prix, the drivers were in top shape, the car had no problems, and the non-racing part of the team (engineers, pit crew, etc.) were in sync and the team had a perfect weekend.</p>
