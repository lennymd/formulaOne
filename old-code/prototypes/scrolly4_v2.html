      <h1>
        The best Formula 1 team
      </h1>
    </section>

    <p>One way to see which team had the best championship season is to look at the number of wins their drivers picked up during the course of the season.</p>

            <p>Hey look! Mercedes did really well in 2014&ndash;2016. Hamilton and Rosberg won 51 of the matches in those three years.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='step' data-index='1'>
            <p>But wait, there were 21 races in 2016, and 19 races each in 2014 and 2015. Mercedes had more chances to win races in 2016 than in either of those years.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='step' data-index='-1'>
            <p>And if we look all the way back, the first Formula One season only had 7 races. Let's normalize the number of wins by dividing by the number of races in the season.</p>
            <p>For example, Mercedes's 2016 run would be:<br>
            <strong>19 wins / 21 races = 0.9047</strong></p>
          </div>
          <div class='step' data-index='2'>
            <p>If we do the same for the rest of the races, we get:</p>
