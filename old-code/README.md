# vis-thesis

This is the work for my Newhouse VIS thesis project. I'm creating a series of interactive data visualizations around Formula 1, looking back on the sport.

I defended v0 in 2019, and in 2020 I'm creating an updated version, framing the story more specifically as finding the best driver pairings (as opposed to the best team). This is more direct.

The command I used for my conda env is:

```bash
conda create --prefix ./env/ python=3.7 jupyterlab pandas numpy bs4 lxml
```
