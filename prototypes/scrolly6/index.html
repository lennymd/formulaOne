		<h1>The best Formula 1 team</h1>

			I want to add a graphical way of introducing the champions, and the teams we'll be looking at.<br>

		<p>
			In the 69-year history of the sport, over 800 men and 5 women have raced to win the Driver's Cup, but only <strong>33</strong> drivers have held it.
		</p>
		<p class="counters" >Michael Schumacher (7), Juan Manuel Fangio (5), Lewis Hamilton (5), Alain Prost (4),Sebastian Vettel (4), Jack Brabham (3), Jackie Stewart (3), Niki Lauda (3), Nelson Piquet (3), Ayrton Senna (3), Alberto Ascari (2), Graham Hill (2), Jim Clark (2), Emerson Fittipaldi (2), Mika Häkkinen (2), Fernando Alonso (2), Giuseppe Farina (1), Mike Hawthorn (1), Phil Hill (1), John Surtees (1), Denny Hulme (1), Jochen Rindt (1), James Hunt (1), Mario Andretti (1), Jody Scheckter (1), Alan Jones (1), Keke Rosberg (1), Nigel Mansell (1), Damon Hill (1), Jacques Villeneuve (1), Kimi Räikkönen (1), Jenson Button (1), Nico Rosberg (1)</p>
		<p>These 33 drivers have all raced for 16 different constructors:</p>
		<p class="counters">Ferrari, McLaren, Williams, Mercedes, Lotus, Red Bull, Brabham, Renault, Cooper, Benetton, Tyrrell, Alfa Romeo, BRM, Matra, Brawn GP</p>

		<p>One way to look for the best championship season is to compare how many races the constructors's drivers won in their championship runs.</p>

					<p>While looking at the number of wins in a season is a good place to start, we still can't make a great comparison. In 2016, when Mercedes won 19 of the season's races, there were 21 races. In 2014 and 2015 there were 19 races in each season. If we look at the runs right behind these, McLaren's 1988 run and Ferrari's 2002 and 2004 runs, there were 16, 17, and 18 races in each season respectively.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-index="-1">
					<p>If we look all the way to the inagural season, 1950, there were only 7 races.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="step" data-index="-1">
					<p>If we want to properly compare the number of wins a constructor had in a season, we have to account for the different number of races in each season.</p>
					<p>We can do this by dividing the number of wins in each run by the number of races in that season. For Mercedes's 2016 run it would be:<br>
						$$ \frac{wins}{races} = \frac{19}{21} = 0.904761905 $$

				</div>
				<div class="step" data-index="1">
					<p>Doing this for all the runs,</p>

				<div class="step" data-index="-1">
					<p>Looking at things now, Mercedes's 2016 run is narrowly pushed to second by McLaren's 1988 run.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-index="-1">
					<p>In 1988, McLaren got the closest to having a perfect season. Drivers Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna won every race in the season except the 1988 Italian Grand Prix.</p>

					<p>In the Italian Grand Prix that year, Senna had pole position and Prost was second on the grid, but they did not manage to win. Prost was forced to retire due to engine problems, and Senna, after leading for 49 laps and with only two laps to go, had a collision with a Williams' driver and finished tenth.<br>

				<div class="step" data-index="-1">
					<p>As mentioned earlier, Mercedes's 2016 run is second in terms of win percentage. A neat thing to note is that the 2016 champion, Nico Rosberg, is the son of the 1982 champion, Keke Rosberg. Whereas Nico's championship year saw his team have the second highest win percentage, Keke's championship year has both the lowest win percentage and the lowest number of wins. Keke Rosberg only won the 1982 Swiss Grand Prix.</p>

					<p>Behind McLaren's 1988 and Mercedes's 2016 runs is Ferrari's 2002 run.

		<h2 class="subhed">Method 03: How close to perfect</h2>
		<p>Winning is good, having both drivers in the podium is good too, but the best performance for a constructor is to have their drivers finish first and second, a 1-2 finish (read: "one-two finish"). A 1-2 finish means that compared to the competition of a grand prix, the drivers were in top shape, the car had no problems, and the non-racing part of the team (engineers, pit crew, etc.) were in sync and the team had a perfect weekend.</p>
